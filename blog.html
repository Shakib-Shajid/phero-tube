                            function-scoped, which
                            implies that the whole function in which it is defined may see it.

                            function that contains them. This implies that even if a var variable is started with
                            undefined,
                            you

                    <ul class="list-disc">
                        <li>Block Scope: Let-declared variables have block scope, which means their visibility is

                            the block in which they are defined.

                            var-declared variables, which are initialized. When trying to access a let variable before

                            Const variables are hoisted to the top of the block that contains them, but unlike let, they

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">undefined</h2>

                    Implicit Absent Value: undefined represents a variable or property that has been declared but
                    has
                    not been assigned any value. It's typically used when a value is expected but hasn't been

                            Missing Properties: When accessing an object property that doesn't exist, JavaScript returns

                            the missing

                    <p>Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, or REST API, is a set of
                        architectural guidelines and restrictions for creating and utilizing web services. It's a
                        well-liked
                        technique for creating scalable, stateless, and simple-to-maintain web services and APIs. REST
                        is an
                        approach to creating networked apps rather than a particular technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>Key principles and characteristics of RESTful APIs include:

                        <li><strong>Statelessness:</strong> Each request from a client to a server must contain all the
                            information needed to
                            understand and process the request. The server should not store any client state between
                            requests.
                            This allows for scalability and simplifies server implementation.</li>

                        <li><strong>Client-Server Architecture:</strong> REST separates the client (the user interface
                            or
                            application) from
                            the
                            server (the data storage and processing), allowing them to evolve independently. This
                            separation
                            promotes modularity and scalability.</li>

                        <li><strong>Uniform Interface:</strong> REST APIs have a consistent and uniform set of resources
                            and
                            methods for
                            accessing and manipulating those resources. These methods are often referred to as HTTP
                            methods,
                            such as GET (retrieve data), POST (create new data), PUT (update existing data), DELETE
                            (remove
                            data), etc.</li>

                        <li><strong>Resource-Based:</strong> Resources are the central concept in REST. Everything in a
                            RESTful system is
                            considered a resource, and each resource is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource
                            Identifier). These URIs serve as the endpoints for interacting with the resources.</li>

                        <li><strong>Representation:</strong> Resources can have multiple representations (e.g., JSON,
                            XML,
                            HTML), and clients
                            can
                            specify the desired representation in their requests using the Accept header. The server
                            responds
                            with the requested representation in the response.</li>

                        <li><strong>Stateless Communication:</strong> Each request from the client to the server should
                            contain all necessary
                            information. Servers do not store client context or session information between requests.
                            This
                            simplifies server implementation and allows for better scalability.</li>

                        <li><strong>Layered System:</strong> REST allows for the use of intermediary components
                            (proxies,
                            load balancers,
                            caches)
                            to improve system performance, scalability, and security. Clients are unaware of the
                            presence of
                            intermediaries.</li>

                        <li><strong>Stateless Communication:</strong> Each request from the client to the server should
                            contain all necessary
                            information. Servers do not store client context or session information between requests.
                            This
                            simplifies server implementation and allows for better scalability.</li>

                    <strong>const:</strong>
                    Block Scope: Const-declared variables have the same block scope as let-declared variables.
                    Const variables are hoisted to the top of the block that contains them, but unlike let, they are not
                    initialized and are thus also in the temporal dead zone.


                    Immutable: Constant variables cannot be reassigned after initialization and are constant when
                    specified with the const keyword. It is still possible to change the attributes or elements of
                    objects and arrays that have been defined with const.

                <p>Key principles and characteristics of RESTful APIs include:

                    Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to
                    understand and process the request. The server should not store any client state between requests.
                    This allows for scalability and simplifies server implementation.

                    Client-Server Architecture: REST separates the client (the user interface or application) from the
                    server (the data storage and processing), allowing them to evolve independently. This separation
                    promotes modularity and scalability.

                    Uniform Interface: REST APIs have a consistent and uniform set of resources and methods for
                    accessing and manipulating those resources. These methods are often referred to as HTTP methods,
                    such as GET (retrieve data), POST (create new data), PUT (update existing data), DELETE (remove
                    data), etc.

                    Resource-Based: Resources are the central concept in REST. Everything in a RESTful system is
                    considered a resource, and each resource is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource
                    Identifier). These URIs serve as the endpoints for interacting with the resources.

                    Representation: Resources can have multiple representations (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML), and clients can
                    specify the desired representation in their requests using the Accept header. The server responds
                    with the requested representation in the response.

                    Stateless Communication: Each request from the client to the server should contain all necessary
                    information. Servers do not store client context or session information between requests. This
                    simplifies server implementation and allows for better scalability.

                    Layered System: REST allows for the use of intermediary components (proxies, load balancers, caches)
                    to improve system performance, scalability, and security. Clients are unaware of the presence of
                    intermediaries.

                    Stateless Communication: Each request from the client to the server should contain all necessary
                    information. Servers do not store client context or session information between requests. This
                    simplifies server implementation and allows for better scalability.
